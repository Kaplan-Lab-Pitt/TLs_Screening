## Data

This folder contains all counted mutations and fitness. And the Supplemental Table 4_library_summary.txt has a simple description of all libraries.

## Epistasis_EdgeBundling

This folder has R code for drawing the EdgeBundling figure.

## SCA

This folder has the bash and Python codes for SCA (Statistical Coupling Analysis). It has two parts. Firstly, MSA(Multiple Sequence Aliganment) with T-coffeev12.00.7fb08c2 , and SCA(Statistical Coupling Analysis) with pySCAv6.1.
